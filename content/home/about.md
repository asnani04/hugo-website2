# Biography

I am a final year undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. I am currently looking for Masters / PhD / Research Assistant opportunities. Much of my undergrad research concerns natural language understanding and synthesis, and my interests span the theoretical foundations of machine learning as well as applications to interesting problem domains.
